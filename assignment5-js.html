            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.
